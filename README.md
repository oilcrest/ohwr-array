# Overview

ARRAY is a system for silicon sensor testing. It consisting of two Printed Circuit Boards:
* an active 512-to-1 switching matrix,
* a passive probe card to contact the sensor.
It has been use to characterise large area silicon pad sensors for the CMS (HGCAL) and FCAL (LumiCal) collaborations.

All design files are open source:
* The hardware design files for both PCBs can be found [here](https://ohwr.org/project/array/array-hardware).
* The firmware can be found [here](https://ohwr.org/project/array/array-firmware).
* A python interface can be found [here](https://ohwr.org/project/array/array-interface-python).
* A LabVIEW interface can be found [here](https://ohwr.org/project/array/array-interface-labview).

A description of the system is published in NIM A (in submission) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10262).
